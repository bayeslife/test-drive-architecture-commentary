#  Test Driven Architecture : Test against models

The aim is to build a model by the composition of pre-existing models and defining linkage constraints between the models.

This process is expected to involve the following steps

- Require the set of models
- Instantiate new models by composing them together.
- Instantiate the new models
- Perform queries against composed model.
