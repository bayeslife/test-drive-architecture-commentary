#  Test Driven Architecture Thoughts

Test Driven Architecture is :
```
effectively describing a solution before it is developed by writing tests which can be used to verify the solution as it develops
```

The value in doing this is
- to realize a feedback loop during the design phase  and
- link the design phase to a deliverables of the development phase  and
- provide better presentation of the intellectual property that the design represents

While this sounds appealing given paradigms such as test driven development , there are challenges to be addressed.
